# Data 100 Project: Cook County Housing 1

## Introduction
This project explores insights from a large housing dataset embedded in the social context of **Cook County, Illinois**.  

The work is divided into two parts:  

- **Project 05-1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Perform basic EDA to understand the structure of the dataset.  
  - Clean the data and create new features to enhance future analysis.  

- **Project 05-2: Modeling & Prediction**  
  - Specify and fit a linear regression model to predict housing outcomes.  
  - Evaluate model performance by analyzing residuals and errors.  
  - Brainstorm strategies to improve predictive performance.  

## Objectives
- Understand and clean a real-world housing dataset.
- Engineer additional features to capture useful information.
- Apply linear regression for prediction.
- Assess model accuracy and identify sources of error.

## Tools & Libraries
