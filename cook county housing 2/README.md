# Data 100 Project: Cook County Housing — Predictive Modeling

## Introduction
In **Project 05-1**, I performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), documenting the thought process that informed later modeling decisions. I also engineered new features and cleaned the dataset to prepare it for predictive tasks.  

In **Project 05-2**, I extend this work by specifying and fitting a **linear regression model** to predict house prices from a subset of features in the Cook County housing dataset. After fitting the model, I evaluate its performance, analyze the residuals, and brainstorm strategies to improve predictive accuracy.  

Finally, I connect these results back to the **Cook County Assessor’s Office (CCAO)** case study, where statistical models are actively used to assign property values. This connection is crucial because property valuations directly affect taxation and, by extension, the lives of Cook County residents.

## Objectives
- Fit and interpret a linear regression model for house price prediction.  
- Evaluate model performance and analyze sources of error.  
- Explore potential improvements (feature engineering, alternative models).  
- Reflect on the **social implications** of predictive modeling in property assessment.  

## Social Context & Fairness
Housing policy and property taxation in Cook County have a history deeply entangled with **racial discrimination** and inequities. Because the CCAO uses predictive modeling to determine property values, it is critical to consider:  

- How errors in modeling may disproportionately affect certain communities.  
- What “fairness” in predictive modeling might mean for property owners in Cook County.  
- The broader societal impacts of using statistical models in sensitive, high-stakes contexts.  

This project therefore not only evaluates model performance but also prompts reflection on the ethical dimensions of applying data science in real-world governance.
