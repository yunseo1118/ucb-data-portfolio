In the exchanges, Mr. Roose\u2019s questions about the rules guiding the operating system, its capabilities and the chatbot\u2019s suppressed desires led to answers like, \"I want to be alive.\" At one point, the chatbot, known internally at Microsoft as Sydney and powered by software from OpenAI, the maker of the chatbot ChatGPT, began writing about fantasies that included stealing nuclear codes, persuading bank employees to hand over customers\u2019 information and making people argue until they kill one another \u2014 all before deleting the messages. Although potentially disturbing, these sorts of responses are not proof of a bot\u2019s sentience; the technology relies on complex neural networks that mimic the way humans use language.

Published late last year, \"The Korean Cookbook\" by Junghyun Park, the chef at Atomix and others in New York, and Jungyoon Choi, a chef and writer, provides nearly 500 pages of comprehensive illustrated coverage of hansik, or Korean food culture. It surveys history, geography, vocabulary, techniques, ingredients, meal structure and the evolution of Korean food, all for the home cook, starting with fermentation and kimchi, bap (rice) and banchan, the other dishes arrayed on the table to elevate that simple bowl of rice. These include namul (vegetables), wraps, pancakes, broths, stews, dumplings, porridges and sweets. The point is made, repeatedly, that despite the ubiquity of beef in Korean restaurants in the West, notably short ribs, vegetables actually dominate the cuisine. There is a great deal to learn. The 350 recipes do not represent a personal collection but a textbook survey, with some simple treasures like superbly fresh raw fish bibimbap, japchae glass noodles, kimchi fried rice and cucumbers stir-fried with richly marinated beef, all calling for ingredients that are easy to obtain. Others are more challenging, requiring dried jujube, salted shrimp, chrysanthemum leaves and Korean pancake mix. (Possible substitutes are rarely suggested.)
