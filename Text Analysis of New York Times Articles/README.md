# Data 100 Homework 3: Analyzing New York Times Articles

## Introduction
In this assignment, I analyze **New York Times articles** covering trending topics from the past six years. The goal is to practice working with text-based datasets and apply modern natural language processing (NLP) tools for exploration and analysis.  

## Objectives
Through this assignment, I will gain experience with:
- Cleaning and exploring a text-based dataset.  
- Manipulating data in `pandas` using string accessors.  
- Creating and interpreting visualizations with `seaborn`.  
- Writing and applying regular expressions (regex) in `pandas`.  
- Performing sentiment analysis on text using the **DistilBERT** language model.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data wrangling  
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) for computations  
- [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) & [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for visualization  
- [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) for regular expressions  
- [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) for sentiment analysis with DistilBERT
