# Data 100 Project: Food Safety 2 â€” Analysis of San Francisco Restaurant Scores

## Overview
This project continues my investigation of restaurant food safety scores in San Francisco, using data from the [San Francisco Department of Public Health](https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/Restaurant-Scores-LIVES-Standard/pyih-qa8i).  

While **Food Safety 1** emphasized data cleaning and preparation, **Food Safety 2** focuses more on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and deriving insights from the cleaned dataset.

## Objectives
- Build on the cleaned dataset from Food Safety 1.
- Explore trends and patterns in restaurant food safety scores.
- Analyze the distribution of violations across restaurants.
- Identify factors that may influence food safety scores (e.g., violation type, risk category, inspection date).
- Practice data visualization to communicate findings.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data wrangling and analysis
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) for computations
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) / [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualization

## Key Skills Practiced
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Grouping and aggregating data with `pandas`
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Connecting cleaned data to analytical insights
