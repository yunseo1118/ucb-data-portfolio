    "Here are some ideas for improving your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject/body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject/body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!'s were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number/percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. Alternatively, you can identify misclassified emails and see which relevant words are missing in your model.\n",
    "1. Reducing dimensionality and/or multicollinearity. There are a few methods to achieve this:\n",
    "    1. Interpret the model coefficients. Note that a feature will be more valuable in classification if its coefficient has a larger **absolute** value. If the coefficient has a lower **absolute** value, the feature likely isn't valuable in classifying emails.\n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust the parameters of your model (e.g. the penalty type, the regularization parameter, or any arguments in `LogisticRegression`) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation for feature and model selection! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "    1. Consider implementing L1 regularization. The [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for `LogisticRegression` may be helpful here. \n",
    "    1. We have imported `GridSearchCV` for you. You may use sklearn's `GridSearchCV` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)) class to perform cross-validation. You do not need to code cross-validation from scratch, though you are welcome to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `GridSearchCV`. Suppose we wanted to experiment with 4 different solvers (numerical methods for optimizing the mode) models for a `LogisticRegression` model `lr_model`. \n",
    "1. We could define a dictionary specifying the hyperparameters and the specific values we want to try out like so: `parameters = {'solver':[{'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'newton-cg', 'saga']}`.\n",
    "2. Running `grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=lr_model, param_grid=parameters)` would give us a model for each combination of hyperparameters we are testing - in this case, just 4 models.\n",
    "3. We fit each model to some training data `X_train` and `Y_train` using `grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, Y_train)`.\n",
    "4. Indexing into `grid_result.cv_results_` with a particular metric (in this case, `mean_test_score`), we get an array with the scores corresponding to each of the models. `grid_result.cv_results_['mean_test_score']`.\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with other hyperparameters and metrics as well. The documentation is your friend!     \n",
    "       \n",
    "You may use whatever method you prefer to create features, but **you may only use the packages we've imported for you in the cell below or earlier in this notebook**. In addition, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models**. No decision trees, random forests, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** You may want to use your **validation data** to evaluate your model and get a better sense of how it will perform on the test set. However, you may overfit to your validation set if you try to optimize your validation accuracy too much. Alternatively, you can perform cross-validation on the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** If you see a `ConvergenceWarning`, increase the maximum number of iterations the model runs for by passing in a parameter, `max_iter`, into `LogisticRegression()`. This should get rid of the warning. For a longer discussion on why this warning appears, you might find [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62658215/convergencewarning-lbfgs-failed-to-converge-status-1-stop-total-no-of-iter) helpful. Convergence of solvers is not in scope for Data 100, but by understanding what the error messages are saying, you can get some useful context on what to do in these situations."

    "To decide which features to use when building your model, it is helpful to conduct EDA. Show a visualization you used to select features for your model. \n",

    "Please include:\n",
    "\n",

    "**You should not just produce an identical visualization to Question 3 in Project B1.** For this section, we’d like you to go beyond the analysis you performed in Project B1. Choose some plot other than the 1-dimensional distribution of some quantity for spam and ham emails. In particular, do not produce a bar plot of proportions like you created in Question 3 of Project B1. Any other plot is acceptable, **as long as it comes with thoughtful commentary.** Here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the correlation between multiple features (look up correlation plots and `sns.heatmap` ([documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html))). \n",
    "1. Try to show redundancy in a group of features (e.g., `body` and `html` might co-occur relatively frequently, or you might be able to design a feature that captures all HTML tags and compares them to these). \n",
    "1. Visualize which words have high or low values for helpful statistics.\n",
    "1. Visually depict whether spam emails tend to be wordier (in some sense) than ham emails."
