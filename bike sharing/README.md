# Data 100 Project: Bike-Sharing in Washington, D.C.

## Introduction
Bike-sharing systems are a modern evolution of traditional bike rentals, where the processes of sign-up, rental, and return are fully automated. These systems allow users to conveniently rent a bike from one location and return it at another.  

In this project, I work with **bike-sharing data from Washington, D.C.** to practice data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis. Beyond basic descriptive statistics, I also investigate open-ended questions about ridership patterns and system usage.  

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw bike-sharing data.  
- Explore the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
- Identify patterns and trends in ridership behavior (e.g., by time, weather, or location).  
- Investigate open-ended questions to generate insights about system usage.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data wrangling  
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) for computations  
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) / [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualization
