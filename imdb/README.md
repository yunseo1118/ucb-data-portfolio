- Practice writing and running SQL queries within a Jupyter environment.  
- Explore structured movie data from IMDb.  
- Answer conceptual and analytical questions using SQL.  
- Combine SQL results with Python tools for deeper exploration.  
- Understand performance considerations when working with large datasets.  

## Tools & Environment
- **Python 3** (Jupyter Notebook, Data 100 JupyterHub)  
- **SQLite / SQL** for queries  
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for handling results in Python
