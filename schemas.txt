The database has 4 tables: `Name`, `Role`, `Rating`, and `Title`.

See descriptions of each table's schema below. We have only included descriptions for columns that could be of potential use in this homework.
    
`Name`: Contains the following information for names of people.
    
- nconst (BIGINT) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the name/person
- primaryName (VARCHAR) - name by which the person is most often credited
- birthYear (VARCHAR) - in YYYY format
- deathYear (VARCHAR) - in YYYY format
    
    
`Role`: Contains the principal cast/crew for titles.
    
- tconst (BIGINT) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the title
- ordering (VARCHAR) - a number to uniquely identify rows for a given tconst
- nconst (integer) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the name/person
- category (VARCHAR) - the category of job that person was in
- characters (VARCHAR) - the name of the character played if applicable, else '\\N'
    
`Rating`: Contains the IMDb rating and vote information for titles.
    
- tconst (BIGINT) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the title
- averageRating (VARCHAR) â€“ weighted average of all the individual user ratings
- numVotes (VARCHAR) - number of votes (i.e., ratings) the title has received
    
`Title`: Contains the following information for titles.

- tconst (BIGINT) - alphanumeric unique identifier of the title
- titleType (VARCHAR) -  the type/format of the title
- primaryTitle (VARCHAR) -  the more popular title / the title used by the producers on promotional materials at the point of release
- isAdult (VARCHAR) - 0: non-adult title; 1: adult title
- startYear (VARCHAR) - represents the release year of a title.
- runtimeMinutes (VARCHAR) - primary runtime of the title, in minutes
    

From the above descriptions, we can conclude the following:
- `Name.nconst` and `Title.tconst` are primary keys of the `Name` and `Title` tables, respectively.
- `Role.nconst` and `Role.tconst` are **foreign keys** that point to `Name.nconst` and `Title.tconst`, respectively.
