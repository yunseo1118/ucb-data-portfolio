# Data 100 Project: Restaurant Food Safety in San Francisco

## Overview
This project investigates restaurant food safety scores in San Francisco using publicly available data from the [San Francisco Department of Public Health](https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/Restaurant-Scores-LIVES-Standard/pyih-qa8i).  

The primary goal is to practice **data cleaning** and build familiarity with core `pandas` functions for wrangling and analyzing real-world datasets.

## Objectives
- Load and explore raw data from the San Francisco Department of Public Health.
- Perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, formatting data types, and standardizing column names.
- Use `pandas` to manipulate, filter, and summarize the dataset.
- Conduct preliminary analysis of restaurant inspection scores and violations.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data cleaning and manipulation
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) for numerical operations
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) / [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualization (if applicable)

## Key Skills Practiced
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Using `pandas` DataFrames effectively
- Handling missing or inconsistent data
- Generating simple visualizations
